## Length 

Our typical length is around 700 to 1000 words.  You can go a bit longer if necessary (we can always split a long post into parts 1 and 2). Minimum is 500 words.

## Topic/Level of detail

In these shorter kinds of articles, it’s typically better to go deep on a narrower topic versus trying to cover a broad topic at a really high level. The main thing is that the post should add value for your particular audience.  People value content when it teaches them something new. 

## Tone

Should be conversational and in plain English, like you’re talking to a friend or colleague. (If you are having trouble getting started writing, sometimes it can be helpful to pretend you are explaining things to a friend who just asked you, “Hey, what’s your post about?”) 

## Keep the intro short, engaging and on point

Don’t take half the article to get to the gist of what it’s about. The intro should clearly convey what the reader is going to learn. You need to capture your audience's attention in the first paragraphs and show them why they should keep reading.

There are numerous ways to do this. You can sum up the reader’s problem and how the article is going to help them solve it, or sum up the question you are going to answer, or the how-to info you’re providing.  Or you can start off with an interesting short anecdote or relevant statistic and tie that into the topic. 

## Make the copy easy to read and to digest

Keep your paragraphs short (1-3 sentences).  Use subheadings as needed to guide the reader. Bullets are good, when appropriate for the content, but don’t go overboard with sub-bullets. It should read like an article, not an outline. 

## Ask questions

Asking the audience questions in your post can help capture their attention and encourage them to keep reading to find the answer. Questions also help readers relate to the content (and to you).

## Embed hyperlinks if appropriate

It’s good to hyperlink to relevant content on our site, such as a related blog post. It’s also good to link to outside content when appropriate. For example, linking to a research study or regulatory guidance you’re citing adds value for the reader and gives you credibility. Just don’t go overboard.
